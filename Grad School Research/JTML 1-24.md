- Going to work on issue #36
	- Model Selection #GUI not highlighting currently selected model correctly.
	- UF_Blue: #0021A5
	- UF_Orange: #FA4616
	- FIXED! Used a Qt style sheet to set a background color to default for all items in the list, and then a background color for the selected items. 
- Attempting to understand issue #31
- Spent time in mainscreen cleaning up "wishy-washy" code logic that used the update_display_background_... functions. Need to continue this though
