# Issue #30 add Coronal Plane Viewer

![[Human_anatomy_planes,_labeled.svg.webp]]

## "We want to add a small box that shows the current 3D views of the implants in the coronal (frontal) plane. This makes it easier to determine if the implant has registered correctly. Makes it easier to view the varus/valgus"

- Need to clarify this - do we want a coronal plane view that is fixed to the coronal plane of the model itself (moves with the model's movements), or to the coronal orientation respective to the fluoroscopy? (90deg rotation from the camera)
