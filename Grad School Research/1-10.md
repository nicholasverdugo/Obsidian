Working on getting #JTA-Cmake to build and run
Project for the foreseeable future is to get #CostFunctionsDLL to be extensible - get it to a state where we have a *generic* cost function, that can be customized and as needed by other labs.
Installed dependencies and downloaded everything else, going to attempt to build via #CMake
