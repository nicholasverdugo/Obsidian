- Found OpenCV library (pre-built with an exe) at [this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/)
- VTK is building correctly as well but #JTA-Cmake is refusing to build without one error
	- Seems Qt-related, going to ask Andrew about what portions to install in lab today
- Rebuilding VTK and installed all of Qt 5.1.1 in order to see if this is a problem - QVTK errors in build process for #JTA-Cmake are all that I'm able to base this off of
	- Attempting to replace instances of `GetRenderWindow()` with just `renderWindow()` in #drr_tool and #mainscreen cpp files.
