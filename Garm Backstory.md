Garm is a young warforged, created near the end of the Last War, and therefore was never actually sent into active service. He is an overly confident spear user, trained to fight since birth, and as a result of this hasn't had much interaction with organics. He defected from his platoon and the only life he has ever known when he decided that he needed to be the strongest of the warforged, and eventually, of the organics, and embarked on a quest to defeat the strongest warriors in the lands in single combat in order to prove both his existence and his worth to the world. As his quest wore on, he suffered defeat after defeat, and while being mocked for his overconfidence was taken under the care of an old sage who was once a great warrior. Garm learned the true nature of his existence from the sage there, and committed himself only to self-improvement from that point forward. His strength bowed to kindness and he resolved to protect and care for those he met on his journeys, instead of trying to overcome and conquer them. While he may understand this, he is still working on truly living it, as his hotheadedness and original purpose take hold of him in heated combat or moments of high emotion. 

Garm is a 6' tall warforged, constructed of a dull, iron-like metal held onto a strong wood "skeleteon" by leather cording. He has the rune for truth engraved on his forehead, as is customary for all warforged, which glows with a faint green color due to the ancient magic running through his body. He wears a simple green set of robes and carries a spear and quarterstaff. His alignment is neutral good.
