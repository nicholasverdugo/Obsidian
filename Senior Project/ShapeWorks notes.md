# Using Shapeworks Studio:
- Notes
	- Decrease number of particles (I am using 64 atm) in order to speed up optimization time so messing with settings produces faster results
	- So far, increasing relative weighting is producing the best results for correlation of points between models
- Rel. weighting at 3

- Rel. weighting at 10

	- Using *default grooming settings* for models in the data set
		- Save the project file and this note to my github branch
	- Enabled normals to attempt to fix the points flipping sides - poor results
