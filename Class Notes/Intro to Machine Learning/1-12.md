# Introduction to Supervised Learning
## Classification vs Regression
- #Classification : 0 or 1 - data can be placed in either one or another class, that's it!
- #Regression - 
- Classifiers can be sub-categorized as well
	- #Discriminative: trying to find a partition - separating the feature space into two regions (anything above a line is one class, anything below the line is another class)
	- #Generative: after the model is trained, the goal is to be able to predict the desired output value of any new unlabeled test data\

## Supervised Learning Flowchart
- Training -> Testing -> 

### Training
1. Collect labeled training data
	1. Often the most time consuming and expensive task (this constitutes the #input-space)
2. Extract features
	1. Extract *useful* features from the input (or observational) data so that they 
3. Select a model
4. Fit the model
