# Why do we conduct #user-research ?

- UX Design mantra: "The user is not me"
- You must include more than one user when researching in order to help generalize!
- Don't assume you know all the context, and don't assume the client knows all the context
- You have to define a *want* vs a *need*
- Needs aren't always stated by the user, but they are manifested by the user
	- awareness of the issue in context is needed to define the needs
- Wants are defined early but the needs often show up after performing research
