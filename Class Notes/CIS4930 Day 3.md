### Class Notes: #ðŸŽ®CIS4930
- Computer programs
	- 3 parts of a program:
		1. Startup
		2. Do stuff
		3. Shutdown
	- Processing
		- A processing application is an instance of a Java class called a `PApplet`
		- has a main() that we ignore
		- each `sketch` is a class, so we can create whetever we need
		- Whatever code we write is ultimately turned into Java
	- Drawing to the screen
		- A window has a cartesian coordinate system, with the top left corner = (0,0)
		- Everything is relative to that origin
		- Center: (width/2, height/2)
		- Each pixel on the screen is one unit
- Lots of stuff about coding in processing went on, I read Vinland instead lmao
	- on chapter 104
