### Class Notes:
- Let Î± solve f(x)=0
	- If f'(Î±)=0 then Newton's method converges only linearly
	- If f'(Î±)=0, f''(Î±)=0, ... , f^(m)(Î±)=0 then Newton's method converges linearly with the rate C=1-ym
	- |x^(k+1)-Î±| <= C|x^k-Î±|
- terminating newton iterations
	- in the bisection method we could determine how many iterations k ensure the error is less than a tolerance E
	- |e^k|=|x^k-Î±| < E
	- Of course, we don't know the error
	- Strategy 1: nased on increment
		- |x^k-x^(k-1)| < E
	- Strategy 2: we want f(x)=0
		- Check |f(x^k)|
		- Terminate based on the residual r^k=f(x^k)
		- |f(x^k)| < E
	- if f'(Î±) ~~ 1 the residual works well
