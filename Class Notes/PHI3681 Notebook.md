- What did Winner oppose about technology?
	- Technological Determinism
		- Advantageous technology causes changes in our society without our input; all we can do is sit by and watch it happen.
		- If there's nothing that we can do, it changes us *necessarily*.
		- Ex: the car, or the smartphone
			- Because of how we structure cities, cars are necessary to travel.
			- Because we have this type of technology (internal combustion engine) we are going to look for the best ways to use it.
			- The fact that it exists means it is going to be used.
			- "You can't put the genie back in the bottle"
		- This does not hold, because there exists technology that *could* be used well for something, but isn't used for it. 
			- Cloning could be used, but we do not, because of moral obligations.
	- Technological Somnambulism
		- The acceptance of determinism - that we are sleepwalking through life without questioning technology's effect on us.
		- It is a simple acceptance of the changes, not an explanation of why they happen.
- What was Winner's position?
	- Technology changes us and our society, and *we can determine how*.
	- We should consider whether or not we want to actually use the new technology, and what changes it may effect on society.
