### Banks 1996 - Accurate Measurement of Three-Dimensional Knee Replacement Kinematics Using Single-Plane Fluoroscopy
- TKR kinematics measurement needs an alternative to skin markers, as those don't fully show the small movements occurring between bones.
- It is best to attempt to measure *in vivo* kinematics as synthetic simulations (*in vitro*) have doubt about whether they are actually correct, or account for all movement happening in the joint. 
- Fluoroscopy creates an opportunity for good measurements as it doesn't interfere with TKR implants, doesn't require markers, and is cheap, efficient, and simple compared to CT scans and MRI.
- The method described in this paper uses little computing power (compared to making a "model and match" technique, where the kinematics would be achieved through intensive six-degree searches) to achieve pose estimates due to using an efficient method of 2-D object recognition and extending that into 3-D pose estimation. 
- Principally, the measurement approach uses
