#anatomy terms

1. Axial (Transverse)
2. Coronal (Frontal)
3. Sagittal (Lateral)
4. Median : Sagittal plane through the midline of the body

![[Human_anatomy_planes,_labeled.svg.webp]]

Medial - towards the midline of the body
Lateral - away from the midline of the body

Superior - above the axial/transverse plane, moving towards the head
Inferior - below the axial/transverse plane, moving towards the floor

Anterior - towards the front of the body, in front of the coronal plane
Posterior - towards the back of the body, behind the coronal plane

Proximal - toward the trunk, near the origin (of the limb)
Distal - away from the trunk, far from the origin (of the limb)
Ankle is *proximal* to the foot
Knee is *distal* to the hip

Make some flashcards for these, definitely important to know!

## Common #imaging Modalities

- PET/SPECT
	- Nuclear
- Ultrasound
	- Sonography
- CT
	- Computerized Axial Tomography
- X-Ray
	- Electromagnetic Radiation
- MRI
	- Magnetic Resonance Imaging
- Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)

## Physical #coordinate system

Medical images have the following properties:
- Image Dimension
	- 2D, 3D, 4D
- Pixel Type
	- UInt8, Int16, Float32
- Image Size
	- Number of pixels along each axis
- Image Origin
	- A vector of physical coordinates of the **first** image pixel
- Image Spacing
	- A vector of physical sizes of a pixel in different directions
- Image Direction
	- A matrix that specifies how the pixel/voxel coordinates in the image relate to the physical coordinates
