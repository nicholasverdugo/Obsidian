- Do some image registration using Joint Track (match model to image and save coords?) for a few of the images in the set we received
- Due 8/25 probably
- Run some phone pictures of the paper target through the OpenCV camera calibration software to get familiar with the pipeline and outputs
	- Add these photos and their outputs to the slides in the Pictus AI folder
