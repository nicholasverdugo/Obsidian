# Goal
Create an affordable, rugged, portable mini computer using a Raspberry Pi. This computer will contain information that would be useful in a bug-out situation, i.e. mechanical repair guides, survival information, maps, etc. Ideally it should also have capacity to communicate wirelessly, i.e. radio/WIFI.

## Components
1. Raspberry Pi 3B (ideally switch to 4 in the future)
2. [Power Source](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S829LBX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1e)
3. [Keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08D615GPG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
4. [Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073S3LQ6Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
	1. This is not a final choice, needs more capacity I think

## Information to Store
- Local area maps
- Wikipedia archive
- Common vehicle repair information
- Guides on foraging food
- Guides on bushcraft
- Survival information
- Common signaling techniques
- Radio codes and frequencies
- First aid information
- Language stuff?
