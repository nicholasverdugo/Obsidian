# Goal
Create an affordable, rugged, portable mini computer using a Raspberry Pi. This computer will contain information that would be useful in a bug-out situation, i.e. mechanical repair guides, survival information, maps, etc. Ideally it should also have capacity to communicate wirelessly, i.e. radio/WIFI.
## Components
1. Raspberry Pi 3B (ideally switch to 4 in the future)
2. Power source
