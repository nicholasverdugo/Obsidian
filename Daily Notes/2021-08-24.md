# JTML Notes
- working on forward pass learning still
- Current work on JTML: 
	- trying to get the "bandaid solution" working
		- using the principal distance value from the calibration file passed in to the optimizer as a maximum z translation value, this should hopefully help the pose estimator with z translation errors
		- calibration.h, camera_calibration.h

## updates
- Future work (fall 2021 project) is going to be to write the algorithm in C++ to perform the algorithm Dr. Banks came up with in 1996 - graphs a line of values based on the theta and r of rays drawn from a centroid of the joint replacement.
- This is called Fourier Transforms - currently we would do it out to 20 values
- This algorithm spits out values that can be used to estimate the formula that describes that generated line, and can be compared to a pre-computed library of values to come up with a good pose estimate.
- sum_proj = amount of pixels that the 3d model of the joint takes up
- sum_seg = amount of pixels that the segmented image takes up (white pixels only)
- z is negative principal distance times the square root of the ratio of these two values
	- the distance is negative b/c the origin is the camera, so the principal distance would be a z distance from the camera
- adding a little function to mainscreen to set the max distance = principal distance if sum_proj / sum_seg > principal distance worked pre-optimizer
	- Need to do the same thing in the optimizer code
		- Potentially need a global variable to handle this across all parts of JTML
