# JTML Notes
#### tags: #üêµJTMLScrum, #üçÇFall2021
- Re-created the system context model in LucidChart
- Talked with Andrew about what the plans for the semester are
	- We want to compartmentalize the functions of #JTML and try to get rid of as much hard coding as possible
	- Switching to torchVision instead of OpenCV
	- Allow users to select options of what they want to do and have the program prompt for inputs
		- This essentially combines all of the steps that we do right now to run JTML
	- Use data structures to create a Tensor with metadata that will hold all of the information we need to run #JTML instead of accessing and saving data at different points at runtime
	- This will allow the program to access a single structure for data instead of many objects
	- We are going to seperate the #CFTools DLL into two parts - one part will generate the Cost Functions (and will allow `Joe Schmoe` to create his own) and the second part will be the Cost Functions themselves
