# JTML Notes
- working with Andrew to figure out the Z translation upper limit stuff
- created a pointer that would point to the CameraController object that stored the principal distance value, and used that to increase the cost function's score if it went over that principal distance

## updates
- The pytorch learning app runs completely now!
- creating a Mat directly from the tensor seems to be the most elegant solution, just be sure to define the height and width, color space, and add the tensor.data_ptr()
```
cv::Mat out(1024, 1024, CV_8UC1, output.data_ptr());
```
