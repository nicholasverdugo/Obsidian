# JTML Notes
- Working with Andrew to fix the cost function problemos
- Trying to include the principal distance inside of cost function calculations as a "bounding box"
- DIRECT_DILATION is crashing the program, due to some wacky stuff happening with the prin_dist_ pointer. Need to figure out how to get the data from mainscreen into DIRECT_DILATION

## updates
- Look into ClickUp for semester planning maybe?
