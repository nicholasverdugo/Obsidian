# JTML Notes
#### tags: #💵costFunction, #📈ztranslation, #🐒learningPytorch 
- Working with Andrew to fix the cost function problemos
- Trying to include the principal distance inside of cost function calculations as a "bounding box"
- DIRECT_DILATION is crashing the program, due to some wacky stuff happening with the prin_dist_ pointer. Need to figure out how to get the data from mainscreen into DIRECT_DILATION
- Not pursuing the vtkBoundingBox route, better solution is just to try and set a max z value as close to the cost function as possible.
- Changing the cv mode to 16SC1 helped
## class
- Look into ClickUp for semester planning maybe?
- working on #🎨IntroDas assignments, Processing Documentation Quiz
