#ZComProject

- Sync wiith Moon and dev team 9/1
- Monitor data codes actively, and AP statuses
- Email the Data Codes sheet to Moon
- Make changes on Iveda's end to accomodate the format of these statuses if needed
- JSON is preferred as it makes it easier to parse the process, backend is written in Java
- Device I/O API should be able to handle the majority of this stuff
- What we want to achieve may not be provided by this API
- I need access to the device I/O API on Iveda's end in order to hook things up
- If the device doesn't support MQTT we could cross that bridge to use webhooks
