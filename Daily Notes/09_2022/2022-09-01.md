# Daily Note
#ZComProject

- Sync with Moon and dev team 9/1
- Monitor data codes actively, and AP statuses
- Email the Data Codes sheet to Moon
- Make changes on Iveda's end to accomodate the format of these statuses if needed
- JSON is preferred as it makes it easier to parse the process, backend is written in Java
- Device I/O API should be able to handle the majority of this stuff
- What we want to achieve may not be provided by this API
- I need access to the device I/O API on Iveda's end in order to hook things up
- If the device doesn't support MQTT we could cross that bridge to use webhooks
- Need to get to the point where we can negotiate with ZCom to ask if they can add functionality that we need
- Do we put it on our team or their team?
- Learn AP Network Topology
- Write out the design logic in a document, topology-wise
- Circle back to Moon on the questions and with the document
- Discover how to map the uplink to the downlink API (?)

Cerebro
_
My module
_ Need to connect module to the WiFi controllers to get info on amount of controllers and their statuses, RESTful is how this would be achieved
Each controller -> many WiFi APs

```mermaid
classDiagram
Cerebro-->My Module : Requests AP data
Cerebro : Cloud Management Server
Cerebro..WiFi APs : Monitors via MyModule
My Module-->ZCom WiFi Controller : Requests data
My Module<--ZCom WiFi Controller : Sends data
My Module-->Cerebro : Sends JSON formatted data via HTTP
My Module : formats data as JSON
My Module : needs auth token for Cerebro connection
ZCom WiFi Controller-->WiFi APs : Requests data
ZCom WiFi Controller<--WiFi APs : Sends data
WiFi APs : power
WiFi APs : MAC_addr
WiFi APs : LAN_status
WiFi APs : LAN_rate
```
