# Daily Note
#IVEDA-Internship 

- Meeting with Sid and Moon
	- **Smart Connect  - find out what this is
		- With this, there will be end device network connections to Edge Broadband Devices
		- 1st implemented: ZCom WiFi Controller, interfaces w/ Cerebro
		- I need to study ZCom engineering documentation (will get in the future)
			- End goal is to integrate their API with Cerebro
			- This is done in order to feed Cerebro the WiFi AP status, especially in the event of a disconnect
			- I need to write a summary report to Moon and Dmitry about the overall implementation plan after I am done with the review
			- If there is anything in the way of parameters that are being shared, I need to understand what those are
			- Closed environment, packaged product
		- **Overall Topologies
			- Since Iveda has many DX and IoT Platforms, I need to know what the network topology is like on site w/ the customer
			- WiFi AP is deployed and its information is gained by Cerebro through Automatic Mass Configuration
				- AMC is some sort of standard form that OPS fills out with predefined parameters/info is needed, which is then imported into the cloud, which parses it and propogates the information to Cerebro
			- WiFi controller will act as a proxy for the WiFi APs and needs to be setup during the AMC process
			- **My goal is to implement logic for Cerebro to be able to be part of the future smart connect
			- Other Pinpoint Dual RF station for IvedaPinpoint will need to provide the station status
	- Any device with multiple connections (BT, WiFi) needs to have its connections known and understood by Cerebro
	- ***Possible Schedule
		- August 8 to August 19:
			- [ ] Study and review the WiFi Controller information for manual and engineering documentation (which I received from Alston)
			- [ ] Gain access to a WiFi controller through Mesa or Taiwan ZCom office
				- [x] Ask for Alston's help with this
				- [ ] Wait for Alston's response to mine and Sid's emails
			- [ ] Ask Moon for assistance with the development environment
		- August 22 to August 29:
			- [ ] Study to propose an implementation strategy and detail the schedule and tasks to the sub-level, overall module architecture to Moon/Dmitry and others (Sid would like to be present for this if possible)
		- September 1 to ??:
			- Up to me and Moon
	- **Admin Protocol
		- Submit weekly progress details by email to Moon, cc Sid & Luz
		- Send Invoices to Moon for approval
