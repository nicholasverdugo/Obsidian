#IVEDA-Internship 

- Meeting with Sid
- Assuming many sites, one controller per site, Cerebro is using RESTful technology to communicate with each device through the cloud
- Cerebro is the top layer, then a controller layer, then the AP layer
	- Controller can already communicate with the APs, but the controller has limited SMP comms with Cerebro
	- Figure out what kind of functions we can get out of this
	- Find out the coding environment, languages (MQTT, Java ?)
		- From Moon
	- Change job description on Invoice to be up to date
