# Daily Note
#IVEDA-Internship 

- Need to look forwards to setting up a meeting with Patrick and Andrew to talk more specifically about the excel spreadsheet
- Find out what sensors are actually needed and can be used, how to mount, power scheme, etc, for each sensor
- Identify if there are corresponding sensors for the tasks that need to be done
	- Identify what actual machines are being used in each stage, link with each cell for each stage
	- Maybe make a seperate sheet for each "sensor" being used
- Simplex, half duplex, full duplex
	- Assign these to each interface used for each sensor?
	- He wants to monitor power use by each device to get an idea of activity level and what is going on at each stage
	- The company Andrew is working with is a power company
	- We need to monitor each key machine's status so that we can ensure efficiency / proper uptime, send alerts if that is not happening
	- Explain this to Andrew, esp. in the powerpoint
		- Ask for customer feedback
	- Work on explaining this concept, work with him 1 on 1 and cc Sid and Patrick when we have dialogue
- Connect the stages on Selena's powerpoint page 11 with the 7 stages I have identified, explain how they differ or apply to what i've done
- Map her 6 stages onto my 7
- Communicate w/ Andrew about the excel sheet, expand the powerpoint with info from the excel sheet itself
