# JTML Notes
C++ Standards Doc: https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-introduction

Building JTML with CMake, automatic GPU detection is failing. 
Fix: N/A - GTX 460 cannot be used with CUDA 10.2, requires driver of version 441.22 or more, this card has 391.22 on it.

Other than that though, the CMake build works and runs. 

Going to get back onto what I was working on previously, getting familiar with libtorch

![[JTML-Log OLD (7-26;8-11)]]

- Fixed the CMake errors, Andrew helped me build a new version of opencv and I linked it in CMake, which allowed the configuration and generation of the example app
## example-app updates
- The program is running up to line 54, crashing at the memcpy stage.
- Need to figure out the correct image formatting and creation syntax for the placeholder tensor
- not sure if placeholder.data_ptr() is the right thing to pass in
- Go through all of the pass in vars and make sure they are correct
- I think sizing is right here, not 100% sure on what is causing the problem atm.
