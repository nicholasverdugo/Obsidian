- Meeting with Sid and Moon (?) 
	- Smart Connect - find out what this is
		- With this, there will be end device network connections to Edge Broadband Devices
		- 1st implemented: ZCom WiFi Controller, interfaces w/ Cerebro
		- I need to study ZCom engineering documentation (will get in the future)
			- End goal is to integrate their API with Cerebro
			- This is done in order to feed Cerebro the WiFi AP status, especially in the event of a disconnect
			- I need to write a summary report to Moon and Dmitry about the overall implementation plan after I am done with the review
			- If there is anything in the way of parameters that are being shared, I need to understand what those are
			- Closed environment, packaged product
		- **Overall Topologies
			- Since Iveda has many DX and IoT Platforms, I need to know what the network topology is like on site w/ the customer
			- WiFi AP is deployed
