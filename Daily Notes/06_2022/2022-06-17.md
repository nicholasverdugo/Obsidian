- Meeting with Andrew Kelly Notes
	- Ask about layout of slides, if he has any suggestions on how to setup in order to best show information and make it easier for him to present
	- Check the amount of words - ask if too much or too little
	- Ask about layout of slides - one stage / slide, or the old format
	- Clarify about RWH
	- Ask if he'd like information about sensors AND groups on slide 3, or one of those two, or neither (that info can be included later, like it is now)
- Questions he has for me:
	- Ask Sid about making a shorter form powerpoint for Andrew, reduce the amount of info as much as possibe
