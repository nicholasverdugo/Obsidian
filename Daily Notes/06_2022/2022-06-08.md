# Daily Note
#SmartWater 

- Sid wants to push me to do smart water harder
- Two files are needed:
	- Smart Water Treatment Solution Review
		- What I basically have already
	- Iveda Smart Water Treatment Solution
		- What is Iveda's offering?
		- Top level of Iveda smart water solution overview
		- Include:
			- Application Server
				- IvedaAI
				- Cerebro
				- Smart Water Edge Server
					- This is what is on site, it is on the customer's network
				- Smart Power Edge Server from the company Andrew had identified in the past
			- Devices that are needed
				- Smart Power Sensors from that above company
				- Sensors for Water Treatment
					- Depends on how the powerpoint looks
				- IP Camera
		- Different Stages - One Slide to Explain this for each stage mAYBE
			- Top/Left showing different stages
			- Try to fit diagrams of everything on one slide????
			- Simplify the explanation as much as possible, make it sequential
			- make a list of a few bullet points for each stage, and use digrams in conjunction with the bullets (a,b,c) (1a,1b,1c, etc) to help illustrate how everything works and needs to be monitored
			- Essentially it is a reformat of my old presentation
		- Need an overall system diagram, use graphics (re: Iveda Smart Fuel)
			- Use groups of device styles maybe?
				- Power monitoring, water quality monitoring, cleanliness monitoring?
				- Include how that connects to IvedaAI, Cerebro, Edge Server, IP Camera, etc
				- For IvedaAI picture use some sort of image of a server rack potentially
					- That interfaces with an IP Camera
				- The Edge Server monitors all of the non-power monitoring sensors (that is handled by the XYZ Smart Power company)
					- Use Iveda Smart Pole gateway as a base
