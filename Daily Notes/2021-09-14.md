# JTML Notes
#### tags: #🍂Fall2021 #🐵JTMLScrum 
- Getting #🍂Fall2021  / future plans for #JTML set up, working with #Andrew and #Joshua to plan out #🐵JTMLScrum for the future.
	- Need to do project planning
		- Splitting the epics (planned functions of #JTML) into user stories to make the product backlog.
			- User stories are requirements/requests written from the end user's perspective
		- Split those user stories into workable tasks. This can be as granular as we want.
		- Assign a hierarchy to the tasks, based on how soon they need to be completed and how difficult they will be (tasks that rely on other tasks' completion come later than the more base line, important tasks)
- Worked on getting the ClickUp board set up with stories and tasks
- The registration graph is fed data, but it calls the functions based on what it needs to do
