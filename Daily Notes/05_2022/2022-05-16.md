#IVEDA-Internship 

- Meeting 05/16
	- #RWH Energy will be working with #IVEDA on smart water solution
	- We aren't water experts, but we are experts in IoT, so we can still provide and offer solutions for water management
	- Andrew is working with #RWH as they are similar to other power providers in smart cities
	- When he brings up our power tech they aren't receptive?
	- Our specialty is combining power with other ecosystems along with software to provide a (more holistic) solution?
	- Water treatment comes into play bc there are 14k facilities in the USA that received money from the govt to improve infrastructure
		- This isn't enough to upgrade them
		- #RWH is going to try to invest in these facilities to give them the resources to perform these upgrades (thousand palms treatment plant)
		- Bringing us in with #Willdan to create smart water improvements
		- #Willdan was approached for exclusivity by #CDMSmith (largest water innovator in the market in the USA right now)
		- We would be brought on to complement their tech
		- #RWH is deciding between #WIlldan or #CDMSmith ( #IVEDA is included with #Willdan )
		- Generate an excel spreadsheet with connections between sensors and stages: what sensors can be used where? what stages share sensors? what total sensors can be used at all?
		- Share the powerpoint with patrick, andrew, and sid so collaboration can happen
